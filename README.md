# React 19 useState Hook Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where the `useState` hook in React 19 doesn't update correctly in a functional component.  The counter does not increment as expected when clicking the button. 

## Bug Description
The `useState` hook, despite using the functional update pattern (`prevCount => prevCount + 1`), fails to update the state value in the UI. This may be related to unexpected behavior with concurrent mode or other React 19 features. 

## Solution
The solution involves verifying the component's rendering process and ensuring that no conflicts exist with other parts of the application that might interfere with state updates.  The corrected component is provided in `bugSolution.js`.
